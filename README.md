# Solar-Power-Load-Sharing
Simulations of standard load sharing circuit used in solar-powered LIPO charger

This repo examines the idea of using a standard load sharing (power path) circuit
in a LIPO charger powered by a solar panel instead of by a fixed 5V supply such as USB.
It presents the results of LTspice simulations of such a circuit.  Everything is
explained in the PDF.
