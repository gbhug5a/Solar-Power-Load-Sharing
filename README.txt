This repo examines the idea of using a standard load sharing (power path) circuit
in a LIPO charger powered by a solar panel instead of by a fixed 5V supply such as USB.
It presents the results of LTspice simulations of such a circuit.  Everything is
explained in the PDF.

Update:  The repo has been reorganized to divide its contents between the standard
load sharing circuit and a new version that uses an opamp to drive the mosfet gate.
The PDF explains both.
